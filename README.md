## Research Focus

Independent security researcher specializing in DeFi protocol vulnerabilities and smart contract security.

**Primary Areas:**
- Oracle manipulation & price feed attacks
- Asymmetric Deficit Socialization (ADS) in lending protocols
- Liquidation mechanism exploits
- Economic attack modeling

**Track Record:**
- Critical findings accepted by Top-10 TVL DeFi protocols
- Active contributor to Immunefi bug bounty programs
- Responsible disclosure practitioner

## Engineering

I build custom security tooling to support my research:

- **Rust-based fuzzing frameworks** for DeFi state analysis
- **Automated audit pipelines** with CI/CD integration
- **Reconnaissance engines** for attack surface mapping

> The repositories below are public samples demonstrating engineering capability.
> Production security tooling remains private for OPSEC.
