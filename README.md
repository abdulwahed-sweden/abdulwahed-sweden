## The Engineering: Ferox-Pro

> *From prototype to production-grade security platform*

I architect and maintain a proprietary security framework that competes with enterprise tools:

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>505,456</b><br><sub>Lines of Rust</sub></td>
<td align="center"><b>36</b><br><sub>Custom Crates</sub></td>
<td align="center"><b>63</b><br><sub>Scanner Modules</sub></td>
<td align="center"><b>2,185</b><br><sub>Async Patterns</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>

**Architecture:**
```
Core Engine     → ferox-core, ferox-engine, ferox-pipeline
Security        → ferox-exploit, ferox-fuzzer, ferox-proxy, ferox-c2
Reconnaissance  → ferox-recon, ferox-crawler, ferox-scan
Blockchain      → ferox-evm, ferox-solana
Integration     → HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti APIs
```

**Why Rust?** Memory safety for security tools. Zero-cost abstractions for performance. Fearless concurrency for scale.

*One engineer. Enterprise-grade output. The code speaks for itself.*
